# CUI-calculator
A *calculator* is a utility device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. 

## About:

It is a basic mathematical calculator program that is developed in python. Python version is 3.x. It performs *Addition, **Subtraction, **Multiplication* and *Division* on two numbers.

## Documentation

### Getting Started:

- This program can run on both Windows and Linux operating system by using pycharm, anaconda 3 or all other python editors with the python version 3.x
- This program is developed by python 3.x.
- It performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division only for two numbers.
- It is more secure which means you may not enter other anything except the numerical values.
- It is more relevant and easy to use for an user.

### Problem Statement: 

Create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.

### Approach:

- User may choose the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be considered valid.
- Two numbers are taken as input and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section.
- Using functions add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide(), we evaluate respective operations.

### Takeaways:

- Understanding of Python Functions
- Understanding of Python Functions Arguments
- Understanding User-defined Functions
